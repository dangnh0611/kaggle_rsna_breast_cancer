Below you can find an outline of how to reproduce my solution for the [RSNA Screening Mammography Breast Cancer Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-breast-cancer-detection) competition. 
If you run into any trouble with the setup/code or have any questions please contact me at `dangnh0611@gmail.com`.

Solution write up: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-breast-cancer-detection/discussion/392449

**Notes:**
- Copy of the trained models can not be upload since the total size is > 2GB. So I create a kaggle dataset to store theme: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dangnh0611/rsna-breast-cancer-detection-best-ckpts

Please download those trained models and put in `assets/trained/`:
```bash
# this assume that kaggle api is installed: https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api
kaggle datasets download -d dangnh0611/rsna-breast-cancer-detection-best-ckpts -p assets/trained
unzip rsna-breast-cancer-detection-best-ckpts.zip -d assets/trained/
rm assets/trained/rsna-breast-cancer-detection-best-ckpts.zip
```

# 2. HARDWARE
The following machine were used to create the final solution: [NVIDIA DGX A100](https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/Data-Center/nvidia-dgx-a100-datasheet.pdf). Most of my experiments can be done using 1-3 A100 GPUs.
However, final results can be easily reproduced using a single A100 GPU (40GB GPU Memory).
- OS: Ubuntu 18.04
- NVIDIA Driver version: 450.80.02
- CUDA 11.6, CUDNN 8.8
- Dependencies (recommended): see [docker/Dockerfile](docker/Dockerfile)
- Pip packages listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)


# 3. DATA SETUP
Refer to [docs/DATASETS.md](docs/DATASETS.md) for details on how to correctly setup datasets.


# 4. SOLUTION PIPELINE
There are some stages to reproduce the entire solutions. I will briefly describe it for easier further understanding.
1. Train a YOLOX on some of competition images for breast ROI detection
    - Convert competition dicom files to 8-bits png images
    - Convert detection labels in YOLOv5 format to COCO format (YOLOX accepts COCO format without any modifications)
    - Train a YOLOX-nano 416x416 model on those images (521 train images, 50 val images)
    - Convert trained YOLOX model from Torch to TensorRT engine.
2. Using trained YOLOX TensorRT engine to crop breast ROI region, save to disk as 8-bits pngs
    - Clean and re-structure raw datasets (competition data + external data) in an unified way (standardize the format/structure)
    - Dicom decoding --> ROI detection (YOLOX) --> ROI crop --> normalization --> save to disk
3. Train Convnext-small model for classification using those saved ROI images
    - Do a 4-folds splits on competition data.
    - Train 4 Convnext-small model on each folds
    - Select best checkpoint for each fold
    - Convert those models from Torch to TensorRT
4. Inference on test data (submission)


# 5. SOLUTION REPRODUCING
All the following instructions assume that datasets (competition + external data) are all set up.
There are 4 options to reproduce the solutions:
1. Use trained models
    - No training, just use trained models in `assets/trained` to make predictions


2. Do not re-train YOLOX, fully reproduce Convnext-small classification models
    - Skip re-train the YOLOX part, use (my) trained YOLOX for further steps
    - Re-train 4x Convnext-small classification models. This part can be 100% reproduced (give you identical models/training log/result) without any randomness.
    - This method should give 100% identical score on both CV/LB/PB

3. Re-train all parts (reproduce from scratch)
    - Won't use any of (my) trained models in any parts, but re-train all of theme from scratch
    - This may not give 100% identical results/scores. The reason is that YOLOX can't be fully reproduced to get EXACTLY same model as used in winning submission. More details [here](docs/RANDOMNESS.md)
    - Note that dataset used for training Convnext-small classification models is generated base on YOLOX's prediction, so changes in YOLOX will cause changes in Convnext-small classification models --> Convnext-small classification models will also be unreproducible (in a 100% way).
    - But in general, it should give nearly identical results/scores within a reasonable margin.

## 5.1. Use trained models to make predictions

### 5.1.1. Convert trained YOLOX to TensorRT

A YOLOX-nano 416 engine which was optimized for NVIDIA A100 is provided at [assets/trained/yolox_nano_416_roi_trt_a100.pth](assets/trained/yolox_nano_416_roi_trt_a100.pth).
However, the recommended way is to convert it to TensorRT, optimized for your environment/hardware:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/src/roi_det/YOLOX:$PYTHONPATH python3 src/roi_det/YOLOX/tools/trt.py \
    -expn trained_yolox_nano_416_to_tensorrt \
    -f src/roi_det/YOLOX/exps/projects/rsna/yolox_nano_bre_416.py \
    -c assets/trained/yolox_nano_416_roi_torch.pth \
    --save-path assets/trained/yolox_nano_416_roi_trt.pth \
    -b 1
```
Behaviors:
- Create new directory `{MODEL_CHECKPOINT_DIR}/yolox_roi_det/trained_yolox_nano_416_to_tensorrt/`.

```
Behaviours: Save a 4-folds combined TensorRT engine to `./assets/trained/best_ensemble_convnext_small_batch2_fp32.engine'`.

It takes 5-10 minutes for Kaggle's P100 GPU to finish, but take about 1 hour for A100 GPU (my case). 


### 5.1.3. Submission
```bash
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/src/pytorch-image-models/:$PYTHONPATH python3 src/submit/submit.py --mode trained --trt
```

Behaviours:
